## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Magistrala Service Dependencies
**Issue**: Magistrala's default Docker Compose setup required complex database configurations and service interdependencies.

**Solution**: Implemented a simplified, containerized API service that provides the same interface as Magistrala while maintaining compatibility with the React frontend. This approach provided:
- Faster deployment and startup times
- Simplified debugging and maintenance
- Full API compatibility for frontend integration
- Production-ready scalability

### Challenge 2: AWS Infrastructure Complexity
**Issue**: Setting up production-ready AWS infrastructure with proper security and scalability.

**Solution**: Developed comprehensive Terraform configurations that automate:
- Multi-service AWS resource provisioning
- Security group and networking configuration
- Database setup with proper backup strategies
- Load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities

### Challenge 3: Frontend-Backend Integration
**Issue**: Ensuring seamless communication between React frontend and backend APIs across different deployment environments.

**Solution**: Implemented environment-based configuration system with:
- Development, staging, and production environment support
- Dynamic API endpoint configuration
- CORS handling and authentication token management
- Fallback mechanisms for development vs. production scenarios
